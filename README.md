# Finding-Donors
The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with
# The data set
The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf)
# ToDo
Change the project to a script to run from the command shell
